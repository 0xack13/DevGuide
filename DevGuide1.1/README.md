# Welcome

This is version 1.1 of "OWASP - A Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and Web Services", released in September of 2002. As you can see, the formatting of this edition leaves a great deal to be desired, but it's still the OWASP Guide. This edition did not last long, it was replaced by a better rendered version not long afterwards.


## History

If you have recollections or earlier drafts of this edition of the Guide, I will very gladly take your oral history in an interview and any materials that created this version of the OWASP Guide.
