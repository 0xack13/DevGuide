This is a single document of the OWASP Guide. 

Two editions

* 3.0 old text - my go at providing a refactoring of the OWASP Guide by re-using previous material. 
* OWASP Guide 3.0 - my new table of contents, but not much content. 


## History

As computers became faster, I decided it was time for a single document version of the OWASP Guide. Beyond a TOC which reflects my current thinking, this version did not get off the ground. 

* 3.0 - never published DO NOT USE
