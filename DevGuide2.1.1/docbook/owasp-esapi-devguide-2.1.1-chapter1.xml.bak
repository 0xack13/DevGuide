<title>About the Open Web Application Security Project</title>
<para>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to finding and fighting the causes of insecure software. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.
<!-- <link>http://www.owasp.org/</link> -->
</para>
<para>OWASP is a new type of entity in the security market. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of security technology.</para>
<para>We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem. The most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.</para>

<title>Participation and Membership</title>
<para>Everyone is welcome to participate in our forums, projects, chapters, and conferences. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, network, and even build your reputation as an expert. Many application security experts and companies participate in OWASP because the community establishes their credibility.</para>
<para>If you get value from the OWASP materials, please consider supporting our cause by becoming an OWASP member. All monies received by the OWASP Foundation go directly into supporting OWASP projects.</para>
