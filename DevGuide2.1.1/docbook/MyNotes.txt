Little things I will deal with later are denoted in the text with ??? within <!-- comments --> as such:
<!-- ??? something -->


Things I will fix and shouldn't take long:

Text styling like bold and italics

<link> links, no biggie.

Proper white-space in the code examples

The lack of ToC navigation/notation of the Ch. 4 content-- no lower level section references/links WTF

add git to source control chapter-- evil eye at current authors/editors
git is awesome
from an official git fanboy wearing the bat underoos (o'reilly animal reference)


Things I will likely fix last:

The location of the Table of Contents (ToC). Until I get the contents in order and establish a pattern then proofread/edit the results. Relocating the Toc in the XLS and the like is farther down on the To Do list.
