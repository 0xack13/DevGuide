This is the first version of the OWASP Developer Guide to really take on the "builder" community. The first few editions of the OWASP Guide were primarily for testers, but this version actually tried to help developers, too.

The 2.0.1 edition has minor differences, primarily a new crypto and buffer overflow after last minute review from Michael Howard of Microsoft. 

## History

Everything that is required to publish the OWASP Guide 2.0 is here. You open up the master document ("Guide 2.0.doc"), find your master document toolbar, and choose "Expand sub-documents". Word will load all the other documents, and become very slow.

* 2.0 - July 24, 2005 Word and PDF (English)
* 2.0.1 - July 25, 2005 Black Hat Edition Word and PDF (English)
