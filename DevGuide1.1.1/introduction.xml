	We all use web applications everyday whether we consciously know it or
	not. That is, all of us who browse the web.  The ubiquity of web
	applications is not always apparent to the everyday web user.
	When one visits cnn.com and the site automagically knows you
	are a US resident and serves you US news and local weather, it's all
	because of a web application. When you transfer money, search
	for a flight, check out arrival times or even the latest sports scores
	online, you are using a web application. Web Applications and Web
	Services (inter-web applications) are what drive the current iteration
	of the web and are evolving to serve new platforms and new devices
	with an ever-expanding array of information and services.

	<para>
	The last two years have seen a significant surge in the amount of web
	application specific vulnerabilities that are disclosed to the public.
	No web application technology has shown itself invulnerable, and
	discoveries are made every day that affect both owners' and users'
	security and privacy.
	</para>
	<para>
	Security professionals have traditionally focused on network and
	operating system security. Assessment services have relied
	heavily on automated tools to help find holes in those layers.
	Today's needs are different, and different tools are needed. Despite
	this, the basic tenants of security design have not changed. This document is
	an attempt to reconcile the lessons learned in past decades with the
	unique challenges that the web provides.
	</para>
	<para>
	While this document doesn't provide a silver bullet to cure all the
	ills, we hope it goes a long way in taking the first step towards
	helping people understand the inherent problems in web applications
	and build more secure web applications and web services in the future.
	</para>
	<para>
	This version 2.0 is a significant improvement over the initial release and a major
	milestone. Not only is the content more eloquently laid out and significantly better
	written but the original content has been significantly expanded to cover web
	services, XML, Microsoft's .NET and Java. You can now find extensive practical
	code samples for the Java and PHP languages and a much-improved common problems
	chapter. You may also be reading this document in a printed published book,
	proof itself that open source documents really are commercially viable.

	Personally I am very proud to be a part of OWASP. There are many talented people involved
	who are a pleasure to work with and learn from. It's a truly fun and very
	rewarding project for all involved performing an important function in this digital age.

	Enjoy,
