# Welcome

This is version 1.1.1 of "OWASP - A Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and Web Services", released in September of 2002. 

This version has many formatting fix-ups, and was the main version in use from 2002 until being replaced in 2005 with the final version of OWASP Developer Guide 2.0. 

## History

If you have recollections or earlier drafts of this edition of the Guide, I will very gladly take your oral history in an interview and any materials that created this version of the OWASP Guide.

* 1.1 - September 11, 2002 PDF (English) (Japanese)

This is the first major translation of any OWASP material. Thank you to those who help spread our mission globally.

The date seems incorrect, as it pre-dates the date in the 1.1 edition, but ... who knows? If you do know, please contact me.
