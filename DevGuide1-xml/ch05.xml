	<title>General Considerations</title>

	<para>
	Web applications pose unique security challenges to businesses and
	security professionals in that they expose the integrity of their data
	to the public.  A solid 'extrastructure' is not a controllable criterion
	for any business.  Stringent security must be placed around how users
	are managed (for example, in agreement with an 'appropriate use'
	policy) and controls must be commensurate with the value of the
	information protected.  Exposure to public networks may require
	more robust security features than would normally be present in
	the internal 'corporate' environment that may have additional
	compensating security.
	</para>

	<para>
	Several best practices have evolved across the Internet for the
	governance of public and private data in tiered approaches.  In the most
	stringently secured systems, separate tiers differentiate between
	content presentation, security and control of the user session, and the
	downstream data storage services and protection.  What is clear is that
	to secure private or confidential data, a firewall or 'packet filter' is
	no longer sufficient to provide for data integrity over a public
	interface.
	</para>

	<para>
	Where it is possible, sensible, and economic, architectural solutions to
	security problems should be favored over technical band-aids. While it
	is possible to put "protections" in place for most critical data, a much
	better solution than protecting it is to simply keep it off systems
	connected to public networks. Thinking critically about what data is
	important and what worst-case scenarios might entail is central to
	securing web applications. Special attention should be given to the
	introduction of "choke" points at which data flows can be analyzed and
	anomalies quickly addressed.
	</para>

	<para>
	Most firewalls do a decent job of appropriately filtering network
	packets of a certain construction to predefined data flow paths;
	however, many of the latest infiltrations of networks occur through the
	firewall using the ports that the firewall allows through by design or
	default.  It remains critically important that only the content delivery
	services a firm wishes to provide are allowed to service incoming user
	requests.  Firewalls alone cannot prevent a port-based attack (across an
	approved port) from succeeding when the targeted application has been
	poorly written or avoided input filters for the sake of the almighty
	performance gain.  The tiered approach allows the architect the ability
	to move key pieces of the architecture into different 'compartments'
	such that the security registry that is not on the same platform as the
	data store or the content server.  Because different services are
	contained in different 'compartments', a successful exploit of one
	container does not necessarily mean a total system compromise.
	</para>

	<para>
	A typical tiered approach to security is presented for the presentation
	of data to public networks.
	</para>

	<para>
	A standalone content server provides public access to static
	repositories. The content server is hosted on a 'hardened' platform in
	which only the required network listeners and services are running on
	the platform.  Firewalls are optional but a very good idea.

	<para>
	Content services are separated from security repositories and downstream
	data storage because the use of user credentials is required.  The
	principle at work is to place the controls and content in different
	compartments and protect the transmission of these confidential tokens
	using encryption. The user credentials are stored away from the content
	services and the data repositories such that a compromise of the web
	tier (content service) doesn't compromise the user registry or the data
	stores (although the user registry is commonly one of the collections of
	information in a data store). Segregating the "Security Registry" from
	the "Content Servers" also allows for more robust controls to be
	engineered into the functions that validate passwords, record user
	activity, and define authority roles to data, and additionally provides
	for some shared resource pooling for common activities such as
	maintaining a persistent database connection.

	As an example, processing financial transactions typically requires a
	level of security that is more complex and stringent. Two tiers of
	firewalls may be needed as a minimal network control, and the content
	services may be further separated into presentation and control.
	Auditing of transactions may provide for an 'end-to-end' audit trail in
	which changes to financial transaction systems are logged with session
	keys that encapsulate the user identity, originating source network
	address, time-of-day and other information, and pass this information
	with the transaction data to the systems that clear the transactions
	with financial institutions.  Encryption may be a requirement for
	electronic transmissions throughout each of the tiers of this
	architecture and for the storage of tokens, credentials and other
	sensitive information.
	</para>

	<para>
	Digital signing of certain transactions may also be enforced if required
	by materiality, statutory or legal constraints.  Defined conduits are
	also required between each of the tiers of the services to provide only
	for those protocols that are required by the architecture.  Middleware
	is a key component; however, middle tier Application Servers can
	alternatively provide many of the services provided by traditional
	middleware.

		<title>Security from the Operating System</title>

		<para>
		In general, relying on the operating system for security
		services is not a good strategy. That is not to say the
		operating system is not expected to provide a secure
		operating environment.	Services like authentication and
		authorization are generally not appropriately handled for
		an application by the operating system. Of course this
		flies in the face of Microsoft's .NET platform strategy and
		Sun's JAAS. There are times when it is appropriate, but in
		general you should abstract the security services you need
		away from the operating system. History shows that too many
		system compromises have been caused by applications with
		direct access to parts of the operating system. Kernels
		generally don't protect themselves. Thus if a bad enough
		security flaw is found in a part of the operating system,
		the whole operating system can be compromised and the
		applications fall victim to the attacker. If the purpose of
		an operating system is to provide a secure environment for
		running applications, exposing its security interfaces is not a
		strategically sound idea.
		</para>

	<sect2>
		<title>Security from the Network Infrastructure</title>

		<para>
		Web applications run on operating systems that depend on
		networks to share data with peers and service providers. Each
		layer of these services should build upon the layers below it.
		The bottom and fundamental layer of security and control is the
		network layer. Network controls can range from Access Control
		Lists at the minimalist approach to clustered stateful firewall
		solutions at the top end. The primary two types of commercial
		firewalls are proxy-based and packet inspectors, and the
		differences seem to be blurring with each new product release.
		The proxies now have packet inspection and the packet inspectors
		are supporting HTTP and SOCKS proxies.
		</para>

		<para>
		Proxy firewalls primarily stop a transaction on one interface,
		inspect the packet in the application layer and then forward the
		packets out another interface.  Proxy firewalls aren't
		necessarily dual-homed as they can be implemented solely to stop
		stateful sessions and provide the forwarding features on the
		same interface; however, the key feature of a proxy is that it
		breaks the state into two distinct phases.  A key benefit of
		proxy-based solutions is that users may be forced to
		authenticate to the proxy before their request is serviced,
		thereby providing for a level of control that is stronger than
		that afforded simply by the requestor's TCP/IP address.
		</para>

		<para>
		Packet inspectors receive incoming requests and attempt to match
		the header portions of packets (along with other possible
		feature sets) with known traffic signatures.  If the traffic
		signatures match an 'allowed' rule the packets are allowed to
		pass through the firewall.  If the traffic signatures match
		'deny' rules, or they don't match 'allowed' rules, they should
		be rejected or dropped.  Packet inspectors can be further broken
		into two categories: stateful and non-stateful.  A stateful
		packet inspection firewall learns a session characteristic when
		the initial session is built after it passes the rulebase, and
		requires no return rule.  The outbound and inbound rules must be
		programmed into a non-stateful packet inspection firewall.
		</para>

		<para>
		Regardless of the firewall platform adopted for each specific
		business need, the general rule is to restrict traffic between
		web clients and web content servers by allowing only external
		inbound connections to be formed over ports 80 and 443.
		Additional firewall rulesets may be required to pass traffic
		between Application Servers and RDBMS engines such as port 1521.
		Segmenting the network and providing for routing 'chokes' and
		'gateways' is the key to providing for robust security at the
		network layers.
