<title>The Black Art of Credit Card Handling</title>
<para>
Every week, we read about yet another business suffering the ultimate humiliation - all their
customer's credit card data stolen... again. 
</para>
<para>
What is not stated is that this is often the end of the business. Customers hate being forced to 
replace their credit cards and fax in daily or weekly reversals to card services. Besides customer
inconvience, merchants breach their merchant agreement with card issuers if they have insufficient
security. No merchant agreement is the death knell for modern internet enabled businesses.
</para>
<para>
What is so aggravating to security professionals is when it comes to credit card handling, businesses
make the same very wrong decisions time and time again, even despite issuers' strong advice to the
contrary. There is no reason to keep credit card numbers. There is no reason to present credit numbers 
to help desk staff or in logs. There is no reason for the business to automatically process reversals. 
</para>
<para>
This section details how you should handle and store payment transactions. Luckily, it's even easier than
doing it the wrong way.

		<title>Don't store any CC numbers, ever. 
		</title>
		<para>
		Many businesses are tempted to take the easy way out and store customer's credit card numbers, thinking
		that they need them. This is incorrect. It's also against most issuer's guidelines. Unless you have a very
		specific need (see the next section), don't store the credit card, anywhere.

	Auth numbers 
	</title>
	<para>
	After successfully processing a transaction, you are returned an authorization number. This is unique per transaction and
	has no intrinsic value of its own. It is safe to store this value, write it to logs, present it to staff and e-mail
	it to the customer.
	</para>
</sect2>
	<sect2>
		<title>Handling Recurring payments
		</title>
		<para>
		About the only business reason for storing credit card numbers is recurring payments. However, you have several 
		responsibilties if you support recurring payments:
		You must follow the terms of your merchant agreement. Most of them require you to have original signed standing 
		authorizations from credit card holders. Even if they don't, this bit of paper will help you if the customer challenges
		your charges.
		It's best practice to encrypt credit cards. This as a mandatory requirement in most merchant agreements now 
		Limit the term of the recurring payment to no more than one year
		Expunge the credit card as soon as the agreement is finished
		</para>
		<para>The problem with encryption is that you must be able to decrypt the data later on in the business process.
		When choosing a method to store cards in an encrypted form, remember there's no reason why front end web
		server needs to be able to decrypt them. Choose algorithms or techniques to reduce the risk of symmetric 
		encryption. For more information on secret storage, please refer to Howard and LeBlanc, and choose algorithms
		and implementations carefully. Cryptography is Hard(tm).</para>

		<title>Presenting a CC number safely 
		</title>
		<para> There are many reasons why sending or presenting a credit card number is handy, but it is fraught with danger.
		Sending an email invoice is a very low cost method of informing users of charges against their credit cards. 
		However, e-mail is not secure. For many workplaces, call centre staff are itinerant casuals with extremely 
		high churn rates. Logs are often attacked not to eliminate evidence, but to obtain additional secrets. 
		</para>
		<para>
		Therefore, when developing a method to track a credit card, it's best to understand how a credit card is created:
		Most credit cards consist of 16 digits (although some are 14 or 15 digits, such as Amex):
		
		XXXX XXYY YYYY YYYC ccv
		
		C is the checksum. X is the BIN number, which refers to the issuing institution. Y is the client's card number. The ccv
		is a credit card validation field which is used by many payment gateways to protect against imprint fraud. Storing this
		value if you do not need it is a breach of privacy regulations in many countries.
		
		The last quad of a credit card should be unique in a customer's wallet or purse, which is good enough to identify which 
		card has been used without causing the customer difficulties even if the number is disclosed on the front page of the 
		local newspaper, let alone an e-mail from you.

	<para>

	<sect2>
	<title>Reversals</title>
	<para>
	There are two potential frauds from reversals: an insider pushing money from 
	the organization's account to a third party, and an outsider who has successfully figured out how to use an automated
	reversal process to "refund" money which is not owing, for example by using negative numbers.</para>
	<para>
	Reversals should always be performed by hand, and should be signed off by two distinct employees or groups. This reduces the
	risk from internal and external fraud. </para>
	<para>It is essential to ensure that all values are within limits, and signing authority is properly assigned. For example,
	a real insider fraud from Melbourne, Australia in 2001 used a mobile EFTPOS terminal siphoned off $400,000 from a sporting
	organization. If the person had been less greedy, she would never have been caught as the business operated within certain
	fraud tolerances, and had poor oversight of this particular area. </para>
	<para>It is vital to understand the amount of fraud the organization is willing to tolerate.</para>

	<title>Chargebacks</title>
	<para></para>
	</sect2>
	
	<sect2>
	<title>Fraud Controls</title>
	<para>Many businesses operate on razor thin margins, known as "points" in sales speak. For example, "6 points" means 
	6% profit above gross costs, which is barely worth getting out of bed in the morning. 
	</para>
	<para>Therefore, if you find yourself on the end of many chargebacks after shipping goods, you've lost more than just the 
	profit of one transaction. In retail terms, this is called "shrinkage", but police refer to it as fraud. There
	are legitimate reasons for charge backs, and your local consumer laws will tell you what they are. However, most issuers
	take a dim view of merchants with a high charge back ratio as it costs them a lot of time and money and indicates a lack
	of fraud controls.
	</para>
	<para>
	You can take some simple steps to lower your risk. These are:
	Money is not negative. Use strong typing to force zero or positive numbers, and prevent negative numbers. Don't overload a charge function to be the reversal by allowing negative values
	All charge backs and reversals require logging, auditing and manual authorization. There should be no code on your web site for reversals or charge backs
	Don't ship goods until you have an authorization receipt from the payment gateway
	The overwhelming majority of credit cards have a strong relationship between BIN numbers and the issuing institution's country. Strongly consider not shipping goods to out-of-country BIN cards 
	For high value goods, consider making the payment an over-the-phone or fax authority
	Some customers will try charge backs one time too many. Keep tabs on customers who charge back, and decide if they present excessive risk
	Always ask for the customer's e-mail and phone number that the issuing institution has for the customer. This helps if other red flags pop up
	A 10 cent sign is worth a thousand dollars of security infrastructure. Make it known on your website that you prosecute fraud to the fullest extent of the law and all transactions are fully logged.
