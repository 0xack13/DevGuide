# Welcome

This is the original "OWASP - A Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and Web Services 1.0", released in September of 2002. Only a few folks wrote it, and it's more of a testing guide than a developer's guide. 

For all that, it's the origin of the global OWASP community. 

## History

If you have recollections or earlier drafts of this edition of the Guide, I will very gladly take your oral history in an interview and any materials that created this version of the OWASP Guide.
